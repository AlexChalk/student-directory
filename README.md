# Student Directory #

This script allows you to manage a list of students enrolled at Villains' Academy.

## Dependencies

You'll need Ruby to run this. For OS X, Linux, or other UNIX-like operating systems, I recommend using RVM:

```
curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
rvm use ruby --install --default
```

For Windows, download and run Ruby Installer, available [here](https://rubyinstaller.org).
More detailed, OS-specific instructions are available on ruby-lang's [installation page](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

## Installation

`git clone path-to-your-repo`

## Usage

Run `ruby directory.rb`. You can also specify a `csv` file from which to load student dataâ€”the program defaults to `students.csv`.
